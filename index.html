        <div class="mini1">
          <p class="p6">The G-Class has been the top model among luxury off-road vehicles since 1979.It is not only by far the passenger car model series with the longest production run in the history of Mercedes-Benz,but also the forefather of all SUVs to bear the three-pointed star – this is why all Mercedes off-road models feature the upper-case G in their name.</p>

        <div class="mini2">
          <p class="p7">AMG brought a G model onto the market as early as 1979. This was followed in 1999 by the G 55 AMG. Its V8 engine produced 260 kW/354 hp. Although the eight-cylinder engine with a displacement enlarged to 5.5 litres adopted the three-valve technology and dual ignition of the series production unit, it also offered high torque of 525 Nm from 3000 rpm alongside significantly increased output. The G 55 AMG was available with closed roof in short- and long-wheelbase variants and as a cabriolet with a short wheelbase.</p>

      <h1 class="h9">Lambo Urus</h1>
      <p class="p17">The 2023 Lamborghini Urus isn’t just an exotic SUV wearing a supercar badge, it’s a supercar with an SUV shell. Not only is that evident by its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 657 horsepower, but also by its gob-smacking performance on famous racetracks—case in point, the new Performante model that broke the Pikes Peak SUV record. Lighter and racier, it’s that newly introduced variant that reinforces Lamborghini’s commitment to ensuring the Urus lives up to the brand’s exotic pedigree.</p>
      <h1 class="h10">Fuel Economy and Real-World MPG</h1>
      <div class="mini8">
        <p class="p18">Those wealthy enough to afford a Urus likely don't care about fuel economy, but Lamborghini's heaviest model sure likes to drink. The EPA estimates that the 657-hp Urus will deliver 14 mpg in the city and 19 mpg on the highway. While we haven't tested its real-world mpg on our 75-mph highway fuel economy route, its mileage will certainly vary based on driving style. For more information about the Urus's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="div8">
        <h1 class="h11">Pricing and Which One to Buy</h1>
        <div class="mini9">
          <p class="p19">Sure, we could save about $35k by opting for the standard-issue Urus S, but that means we’d also miss out on its maximum performance. That’s why we want the new-for-2023 Performante, which features a lower suspension with firmer steel springs, myriad weight-reduction measures, and more. We’d opt for the larger 23-inch wheels, too, with the racetrack-ready Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R rubber. Again, the mission is max performance.</p>

        <h1 class="h12">Interior, Comfort, and Cargo</h1>
        <div class="mini10">
          <p class="p20">Inside, occupants are treated to a dramatic cabin that's classic Lambo. Jet-fighter design cues abound, with the start button hiding beneath a red flip cover and the shifter looking like a jet's throttle. To the left of the shifter are levers that control the drive modes and allow customizable performance settings. There is plenty of faux-suede and carbon-fiber trim, while the infotainment system and reconfigurable gauges are straight out of an Audi. The back seat has good passenger space and can fit between two and three people depending on which seating configuration is selected. Interior cubby storage is highlighted by useful door pockets and a bin behind the floating center stack. The Urus also offers up to 22 cubic feet in its cargo area but that drops by 2 cubes with the optional rear bucket seats.</p>
