              <p>
                The G-Class has been the top model among luxury off-road
                vehicles since 1979.It is not only by far the passenger car
                model series with the longest production run in the history of
                Mercedes-Benz,but also the forefather of all SUVs to bear the
                three-pointed star – this is why all Mercedes off-road models
                feature the upper-case G in their name.

              <p>
                AMG brought a G model onto the market as early as 1979. This was
                followed in 1999 by the G 55 AMG. Its V8 engine produced 260
                kW/354 hp. Although the eight-cylinder engine with a
                displacement enlarged to 5.5 litres adopted the three-valve
                technology and dual ignition of the series production unit, it
                also offered high torque of 525 Nm from 3000 rpm alongside
                significantly increased output. The G 55 AMG was available with
                closed roof in short- and long-wheelbase variants and as a
                cabriolet with a short wheelbase.

          </div>
          <p>
            The 2023 Lamborghini Urus isn’t just an exotic SUV wearing a
            supercar badge, it’s a supercar with an SUV shell. Not only is that
            evident by its twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 that makes 657 horsepower,
            but also by its gob-smacking performance on famous racetracks—case
            in point, the new Performante model that broke the Pikes Peak SUV
            record. Lighter and racier, it’s that newly introduced variant that
            reinforces Lamborghini’s commitment to ensuring the Urus lives up to
            the brand’s exotic pedigree.
          </p>

              <h1>Fuel economy and Real-World MPG</h1>
              <p>
                Those wealthy enough to afford a Urus likely don't care about
                fuel economy, but Lamborghini's heaviest model sure likes to
                drink. The EPA estimates that the 657-hp Urus will deliver 14
                mpg in the city and 19 mpg on the highway. While we haven't
                tested its real-world mpg on our 75-mph highway fuel economy
                route, its mileage will certainly vary based on driving style.
                For more information about the Urus's fuel economy, visit the
                EPA's website.

              <h1>Pricing and Which One to Buy</h1>
              <p>
                Sure, we could save about $35k by opting for the standard-issue
                Urus S, but that means we’d also miss out on its maximum
                performance. That’s why we want the new-for-2023 Performante,
                which features a lower suspension with firmer steel springs,
                myriad weight-reduction measures, and more. We’d opt for the
                larger 23-inch wheels, too, with the racetrack-ready Pirelli P
                Zero Trofeo R rubber. Again, the mission is max performance.

                Inside, occupants are treated to a dramatic cabin that's classic
                Lambo. Jet-fighter design cues abound, with the start button
                hiding beneath a red flip cover and the shifter looking like a
                jet's throttle. To the left of the shifter are levers that
                control the drive modes and allow customizable performance
                settings. There is plenty of faux-suede and carbon-fiber trim,
                while the infotainment system and reconfigurable gauges are
                straight out of an Audi. The back seat has good passenger space
                and can fit between two and three people depending on which
                seating configuration is selected. Interior cubby storage is
                highlighted by useful door pockets and a bin behind the floating
                center stack. The Urus also offers up to 22 cubic feet in its
                cargo area but that drops by 2 cubes with the optional rear
                bucket seats.
